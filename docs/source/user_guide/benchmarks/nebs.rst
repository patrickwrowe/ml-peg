Li diffusion
============

Summary
-------

Performance in predicting activation energies of Li diffusion along the [010] and [001]
directions of LiFePO_4.

Metrics
-------

1. [010] (path B) energy barrier error

The initial and final structures for the diffusion of lithium along [010] are created
through deletion an atom from the initial structure. These structures are relaxed,
and the Nudged Elastic Band method is used to calculate the energy barrier. This is
compared to the reference activation energy for this path.


2. [001] (path C) energy barrier error

The initial and final structures for the diffusion of lithium along [001] are created
through deletion an atom from the initial structure. These structures are relaxed,
and the Nudged Elastic Band method is used to calculate the energy barrier. This is
compared to the reference activation energy for this path.

Si defects
==========

Summary
-------

Performance in predicting DFT singlepoint energies and forces along fixed nudged-elastic-band
(NEB) images for a silicon interstitial migration pathway.

Metrics
-------

For each of the three NEB datasets (64 atoms, 216 atoms, and 216 atoms di-to-single), MLIPs are
evaluated on the same ordered NEB images as the reference.

1. Energy MAE

Mean absolute error (MAE) of *relative* energies along the NEB, shifting image 0 to 0 eV
for both the DFT reference and the MLIP predictions.

2. Force MAE

Mean absolute error (MAE) of forces across all atoms and images along the NEB.

Oxygen adatom diffusion on 2D TMDs
==================================

Summary
-------

Performance in predicting diffusion barriers for oxygen adatom migration on monolayer 2D transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) surfaces.

Metrics
-------

1. Diffusion barrier error

The diffusion barrier is defined as the maximum energy along the climbing-image NEB
(cNEB) minimum energy path (MEP), relative to the initial state energy. This is
compared to the reference DFT-PBE calculated barrier for each material.

The benchmark includes the following 2D TMD materials (2H phase):

* MoS₂
* MoSe₂
* MoTe₂
* WS₂
* WSe₂
* WTe₂

For each material, the endpoints are first relaxed using LBFGS until the maximum force
component is below 0.1 eV/Å or 100 steps is reached. The cNEB band is constructed with
11 images, and interpolation is attempted with pymatgen's structure interpolation,
falling back to ASEs interpolation if any exceptions are raised during optimisation,
which is carried out by ASE's NEBOptimizer.


Computational cost
------------------

Medium: tests involving multiple foundation models are likely to take around an one hour to run on a single GPU.
