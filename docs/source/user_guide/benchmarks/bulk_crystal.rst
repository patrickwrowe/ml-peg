Lattice constants
=================

Summary
-------

Performance in evaluating lattice constants for 23 solids, including pure elements,
binary compounds, and semiconductors.


Metrics
-------

1. MAE (Experimental)

Mean lattice constant error compared to experimental data

For each formula, a bulk crystal is built using the experimental lattice constants and
lattice type for the initial structure. This structure is optimised for each model
using the LBFGS optimiser, with the FrechetCellFilter applied to allow optimisation of
the cell, until the largest absolute Cartesian component of any interatomic force is
less than 0.03 eV/Å. The lattice constants of this optimised structure are then
compared to experimental values.


2. MAE (PBE)

Mean lattice constant error compared to PBE data

Same as (1), but optimised lattice constants are compared to reference PBE data.


Computational cost
------------------

Low: tests are likely to less than a minute to run on CPU.

Elasticity
==========

Summary
-------

Bulk and shear moduli calculated for 12122 bulk crystals from the materials project.


Metrics
-------

(1) Bulk modulus MAE

Mean absolute error (MAE) between predicted and reference bulk modulus (B) values.

MatCalc's ElasticityCalc is used to deform the structures with normal (diagonal) strain
magnitudes of ±0.01 and ±0.005 for ϵ11, ϵ22, ϵ33, and off-diagonal strain magnitudes of
±0.06 and ±0.03 for ϵ23, ϵ13, ϵ12. The Voigt-Reuss-Hill (VRH) average is used to obtain
the bulk and shear moduli from the stress tensor. Both the initial and deformed
structures are relaxed with MatCalc's default ElasticityCalc settings. For more information, see
`MatCalc's ElasticityCalc documentation
<https://github.com/materialsvirtuallab/matcalc/blob/main/src/matcalc/_elasticity.py>`_.

Analysis excludes materials with:
    * B ≤ 0, B > 500 and G ≥ 0, G > 500 structures.
    * H2, N2, O2, F2, Cl2, He, Xe, Ne, Kr, Ar
    * Materials with density < 0.5 (less dense than Li, the lowest density solid element)

(2) Shear modulus MAE

Mean absolute error (MAE) between predicted and reference shear modulus (G) values

Calculated alongside (1), with the same exclusion criteria used in analysis.

(3) Elastic tensor MAE

Element-wise mean absolute error of the 6x6 Voigt-form elasticity tensor.

Symmetry-independent elastic constants are extracted based on crystal system:
triclinic, monoclinic, orthorhombic, tetragonal, trigonal, hexagonal, or cubic.
Symmetry checks are applied to components on the diagonal with a relative tolerance of 10%. If checks fail, a triclinic symmetry is assumed. Tensor components which are zero in both the reference and comparison tensors are excluded.

Computational cost

Phonons: Diamond
================

Summary
-------

Performance in predicting the phonon dispersion and thermal properties of bulk
diamond (Carbon).

The benchmark evaluates (1) phonon frequency accuracy along a fixed high-symmetry
path in the Brillouin zone, and (2) the Grüneisen parameter, Debye temperature, and
Slack-formula lattice thermal conductivity — all compared against RSCAN DFT references.
The total phonon density of states (DOS) is additionally computed and displayed
alongside the dispersion in the app for qualitative comparison.
The thermal metrics probe two physically independent aspects of the force constants:
anharmonicity (Grüneisen parameter) and absolute stiffness (Debye temperature).


Metrics
-------

1. Band MAE

Mean absolute error (MAE) between predicted and reference phonon frequencies.
It is evaluated over all q-points and all phonon branches.


2. Δγ

Absolute error in the mean Grüneisen parameter relative to the DFT reference.
The mean Grüneisen parameter is computed on a 20×20×20 q-mesh by finite differences
between force constants at volumes V\ :sub:`0` ± 1% (see the Method section below).

3. Δθ\ :sub:`D` (K)

Absolute error in the Debye temperature relative to the DFT reference. The Debye
temperature is estimated from the maximum phonon frequency on a 20×20×20 mesh:
θ\ :sub:`D` = ℏω\ :sub:`max` / k\ :sub:`B`.

4. Δκ\ :sub:`L` (W/m·K)

Absolute error in the Slack-formula lattice thermal conductivity at 300 K relative
to the DFT reference. Both prediction and reference use the identical Slack formula,
so this metric isolates MLIP error in the force constants rather than Slack
approximation error.

**Score thresholds**

The ``bad`` thresholds in ``metrics.yml`` are set as follows. The band MAE bar
(1 THz) corresponds to 2.5% of diamond's 40 THz spectrum — a deliberately strict
choice, so that only quantitatively accurate force constants score. Δγ = 0.2
corresponds to a 20% error in the predicted thermal expansion
(α ∝ γ) and to the spread among experimental determinations of diamond's Grüneisen
parameter. Δθ\ :sub:`D` = 90 K corresponds to a ~1.9 THz error in the highest phonon
frequency (θ\ :sub:`D` = ħω\ :sub:`max`/k\ :sub:`B` ≈ 48 K per THz), consistent with
the band-structure threshold. Δκ\ :sub:`L` = 400 W/m/K (≈50% of the reference κ)
approximately equals the κ error obtained by propagating the Δγ and Δθ\ :sub:`D`
bars through the Slack formula (κ ∝ θ\ :sub:`D`\ ³/γ²), keeping the three thermal
thresholds mutually consistent.


Method
------

All MLIP calculations (band structure and thermal) use the **512-atom conventional
supercell** (cubic 8-atom cell × 4×4×4). All DFT references (band structure and
thermal) use the **128-atom primitive supercell** (CASTEP/RSCAN), which is sufficient
for DFT due to the rapid decay of diamond's interatomic force constants.

**Relaxation**

Before computing force constants, atomic positions are relaxed for each model using
the FIRE optimiser with symmetry fixed (``fmax=0.005``, up to 1000 steps).
The cell is kept fixed at the reference geometry so
that band paths remain directly comparable to the DFT reference.

**Phonon band structure**

Force constants are computed from phonopy-generated ±0.01 Å displacements, equivalent
to the displacement dataset used for the DFT reference. MLIP forces are evaluated for
each displaced supercell and used to produce second-order force constants via phonopy,
which are then symmetrised. The force constants are Fourier-interpolated to the
reference q-point path, and phonon frequencies are compared mode-by-mode after sorting
to avoid branch-labelling ambiguities.

**Phonon density of states**

The total DOS is computed from the same equilibrium force constants on a 20×20×20
q-mesh via phonopy (``run_mesh`` + ``run_total_dos``), as in the general and Ti64
phonon benchmarks, and rendered next to the band structure in the interactive
dispersion plot. No DOS-based metric is scored.

**Grüneisen parameter**

The mode Grüneisen parameter describes how phonon frequencies shift with volume:

.. math::

   \gamma_i(\mathbf{q}) = -\frac{V}{\omega_i(\mathbf{q})}
   \frac{\partial \omega_i(\mathbf{q})}{\partial V}

It is computed from three sets of second-order force constants:

1. Equilibrium volume :math:`V_0` — force constants at the relaxed volume.
2. Expanded volume :math:`V_0(1 + \delta)` — force constants at +1% volumetric strain.
3. Compressed volume :math:`V_0(1 - \delta)` — force constants at −1% volumetric strain.

The volumetric strain is applied as a uniform scaling of the unit cell
(:math:`\delta = 0.01` by default). Atomic positions are scaled affinely with the cell,
no re-relaxation is performed at the strained volumes. Mode Grüneisen parameters are
evaluated on a 20×20×20 sampling mesh via phonopy's ``PhonopyGruneisen`` interface. The
reported scalar :math:`\bar{\gamma}` is the q-point- and mode-weighted mean over all
positive-frequency modes.

**Debye temperature**

The Debye temperature is estimated from the maximum phonon frequency on the sampling
mesh:

.. math::

   \theta_D = \frac{\hbar \omega_{\max}}{k_B}

where :math:`\omega_{\max} = 2\pi f_{\max}` and :math:`f_{\max}` is the largest
frequency (THz) found on the 20×20×20 mesh.

**Lattice thermal conductivity**

The lattice thermal conductivity is estimated using the Slack formula (Slack, 1973):

.. math::

   \kappa_L = A \frac{\bar{M} \, \theta_D^3 \, \delta_a}
                     {\bar{\gamma}^2 \, n^{2/3} \, T}

where :math:`A = 2.43 \times 10^{-6}`, :math:`\bar{M}` is the mean atomic mass (amu),
:math:`\delta_a = (V_\text{prim}/n)^{1/3}` is the cube root of the volume per atom (Å),
:math:`\bar{\gamma}` is the mean Grüneisen parameter, :math:`n` is the number of atoms
in the primitive cell, and :math:`T` is temperature (K). The result is in W/(m·K).

The Slack formula is a semi-empirical approximation that captures the dominant anharmonic
scattering channel. It does not include phonon–phonon scattering from third-order force
constants and should be treated as an order-of-magnitude estimate.


Computational cost
------------------

Low: band-structure and thermal-property calculations together typically take
several minutes to tens of minutes per model on CPU. Both steps use the same 512-atom
conventional supercell and share the equilibrium force constants; the thermal step
adds force-constant evaluations at V\ :sub:`0` + δ and V\ :sub:`0` − δ, so total wall
time is roughly three times the band-structure-only run. Calculations were run as a
single process on CPU on an x86_64 machine (11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-1145G7;
4 cores / 8 threads). No explicit parallel execution (MPI or multiprocessing) was used
in the benchmark driver.




Data availability
-----------------

* ``diamond.xyz``: conventional cubic cell (8 atoms, a = 3.56 Å), the
  CASTEP/RSCAN-relaxed geometry used for the DFT reference calculations; each MLIP
  re-relaxes atomic positions (fixed cell and symmetry) and computes force constants
  on a 4×4×4 (512-atom) supercell.

* DFT phonon band structure for bulk diamond along a fixed high-symmetry path,
  computed with CASTEP using the RSCAN functional, pre-converted to the shared phonon
  benchmark format, along with the q-path metadata used for the MLIP band structures.

* DFT total phonon DOS (``diamond_dos.npz``), computed from the same DFT force
  constants on a 20×20×20 q-mesh in the shared phonon benchmark format (phonopy
  ``get_total_dos_dict()``: frequency points in THz and total DOS).

* DFT Grüneisen parameter and lattice thermal conductivity computed using the same
  Grüneisen + Slack pipeline as the MLIP predictions, with CASTEP/RSCAN force constants
  at V\ :sub:`0`, V\ :sub:`0` + 1%, and V\ :sub:`0` − 1% on a 128-atom primitive
  supercell.

The reference data is independent of public DFT databases, though diamond chemistry
should be in-domain for models trained on bulk-materials datasets such as OMat24.


Phonons: Ti64
=============

Summary
-------

Performance in predicting phonon dispersions, vibrational densities of states (DOS),
and thermodynamic Helmholtz free energies for a suite of 10 Ti–Al–V alloy phases.

Each case is evaluated by comparing ML-predicted phonon frequencies to CASTEP reference
phonon frequencies along a fixed high-symmetry q-path. For a subset of cases,
Helmholtz free-energy errors per atom are additionally reported.


Metrics
-------

1. ω_avg MAE

   Mean absolute error (MAE) in the average phonon frequency ω_avg over the 10 Ti64 cases.

   For each case, ω_avg is computed as the arithmetic mean of all phonon frequencies after
   interpolating the reference dispersion onto the ML band-path grid. The per-case absolute
   error is then averaged across cases. Frequencies are averaged as stored; if imaginary modes
   are present as negative values, they contribute directly.

2. ω_max MAE

   Mean absolute error in the maximum phonon frequency ω_max over the 10 Ti64 cases.

   For each case, ω_max is the largest frequency after interpolating the reference
   dispersion onto the ML band-path grid. The per-case absolute error is then
   averaged across cases.

3. ΔF (0 K) mean

   Mean absolute error in Helmholtz free energy at 0 K, reported as eV/atom, over the
   subset of cases where thermodynamic outputs are available.

   For applicable cases, a reference Helmholtz free energy is provided, computed in the
   harmonic approximation from CASTEP q-point phonon frequencies and weights (zero-point
   plus thermal contributions) on a temperature grid spanning 0–2000 K in 10 K steps, and
   interpolated to the ML temperatures. The ML free energy is computed with phonopy on the
   same temperature grid. The absolute difference between ML and reference free energy at
   0 K is divided by the number of atoms and averaged across thermodynamics-enabled cases.
   Weights are taken directly from CASTEP; no explicit renormalisation is applied.

4. ΔF (2000 K) mean

   Mean absolute error in Helmholtz free energy at 2000 K, reported as eV/atom, over the
   subset of cases where thermodynamic outputs are available.

   Computed as in (3), but using the final temperature point (2000 K).

**Score thresholds**

The ``bad`` thresholds in ``metrics.yml`` are set as follows. The ω_avg and ω_max
MAE bars (1 THz, 10% of the spectrum) bound systematic softening or stiffening
of the lattice and errors at the top of the phonon spectrum. The Helmholtz free-energy
bars (7 meV/atom at 0 K, ≈20% of the ~35 meV/atom zero-point energy; 30 meV/atom at
2000 K) are set so that errors beyond them are comparable to the phase free-energy
differences (tens of meV/atom) that such calculations are used to resolve.


Computational cost
------------------

Low: dispersion, DOS and thermodynamic calculations typically take minutes per model on CPU.
Thermodynamic calculations are enabled for a 7/10 subset of cases.
Ti64 calculations were run as a single process on CPU on an
x86_64 machine (11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-1145G7; 4 cores / 8 threads). No explicit
parallel execution (MPI or multiprocessing) was used in the benchmark driver.

patterns studied here come from the Allen & Bartók dataset and do not appear in these
training sets.
Energy-volume curves for metals
===============================

Summary
-------

Energy-volume (equation of state) curves and phase stability for metals (W, Nb, Mo, Ta, Ti, Zr, Cr, Fe), benchmarked against PBE reference data.

Metrics
-------

1. Δ metric is adapted from `Lejaeghere, K., et. al. Reproducibility in density functional theory
   calculations of solids. (2016). Science, 351(6280), aad3000.
   <https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aad3000>`_. It measures difference between predicted and reference energy-volume curves and is calculated as the square root of the integrated squared energy difference between the predicted and reference curves. It is normalized by the volume range and provides a single number in meV/atom. Here we use it to extimate how good the model reproduce the reference PBE energy-volume curve for the ground state structure of each metal. Note that the volume range is larger than in the original paper, so the Δ metric values are not directly comparable to those reported in the original paper.

   .. math::

      \Delta = \sqrt{\frac{\int_{V_i}^{V_f} \left[ E_\text{model}(V) - E_\text{ref}(V) \right]^2 \mathrm{d}V}{V_f - V_i}}

   where :math:`E(V)` is the Birch-Murnaghan energy-volume curve and the integral runs over
   a fixed volume range :math:`[V_i, V_f]` around the reference equilibrium volume.
   The result is in meV/atom.

2. Phase energy MAE

   Mean absolute error of the phase energy differences (relative to the ground-state
   phase) evaluated on a uniform volume grid from BM-fitted curves:

   .. math::

      \text{Phase energy MAE} = \frac{1}{N_\phi N_V}
      \sum_{\phi,\, j}
      \left| \Delta E_\text{model}^{\phi}(V_j) - \Delta E_\text{ref}^{\phi}(V_j) \right|

   where :math:`\Delta E^\phi(V) = E^\phi(V) - E^{\phi_0}(V)` is the energy of phase
   :math:`\phi` relative to the ground-state phase :math:`\phi_0`.

   Result in meV/atom. It measures how well the model reproduces the relative energies of different phases across the volume range.

3. Phase stability

   Percentage of volume grid points at which the model correctly identifies all non-ground-state phases as higher in energy than the ground-state phase. A value of 100 % means the model preserves the correct phase ordering at every
   volume point. This metric is practically important: it indicates whether a model predicts spurious phase transitions under extreme conditions, such as the high tensile stresses at a crack tip.

Computational cost
------------------

Low. Every eos curve requires 50 calls on unit cells.

High-Pressure Relaxation
========================

Summary
-------

Performance in relaxing bulk crystal structures under high-pressure conditions.
3000 structures from the Alexandria database are relaxed at 7 pressure conditions
(0, 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150 GPa) and compared to PBE reference calculations.


Metrics
-------

For each pressure condition (0, 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150 GPa):

(1) Volume MAE

Mean absolute error of volume per atom compared to PBE reference.

(2) Energy MAE

Mean absolute error of enthalpy per atom compared to PBE reference. The enthalpy is
calculated as H = E + PV, where E is the potential energy, P is the applied pressure,
and V is the volume.

(3) Convergence

Percentage of structures that successfully converged during relaxation.

Structures are relaxed using janus-core's GeomOpt with the ase `FixSymmetry` constraint
applied to preserve crystallographic symmetry analogously to DFT. Starting from P000 (0 GPa) structures, each structure is relaxed at the target pressure using the FrechetCellFilter with the
specified scalar pressure. Relaxation continues until the maximum force component is
below 0.0002 eV/Å or until 500 steps are reached. If not converged, relaxation is
repeated up from the last structure of the previous relaxation up to 3 times.


Computational cost
------------------

High: tests are likely to take hours-days to run on GPU, depending on the number of
structures and pressure conditions tested.

relaxation to the appropriate dimensions and compared to PBE reference calculations.


Metrics
-------

(6) Convergence (1D)

Percentage of 1D structures that successfully converged during relaxation.

Structures are relaxed using janus-core's GeomOpt with the ase `FixSymmetry` constraint
applied to preserve crystallographic symmetry. Cell relaxation is constrained using
cell masks:

* 2D: Only in-plane cell components (a, b, and γ) are allowed to relax
* 1D: Only the chain direction (a) is allowed to relax

Relaxation continues until the maximum force component is below 0.0002 eV/Å or until
500 steps are reached. If not converged, relaxation is repeated up to 3 times.

Iron Properties
===============

Summary
-------

This benchmark evaluates MLIP performance on a comprehensive set of BCC iron
properties relevant to plasticity and fracture. The benchmark is based on
`Zhang et al. (2023) <https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10072>`_, which assessed the
efficiency, accuracy, and transferability of machine learning potentials for
dislocations and cracks in iron.

Seven groups of properties are computed and compared against DFT (PBE) reference
values: equation of state, elastic constants, the Bain path, vacancy formation
energy, surface energies, generalised stacking fault energies, and
traction-separation curves.

Metrics
-------

EOS properties
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Lattice parameter error (%)

The equilibrium BCC lattice parameter :math:`a_0` is obtained by fitting a
third-order Birch-Murnaghan equation of state to 30 energy-volume points
sampled around 2.834 Å. The percentage error relative to the DFT reference
value (2.831 Å) is reported.

2. Bulk modulus error (%)

The bulk modulus :math:`B_0` is extracted from the same EOS fit. The
percentage error relative to the DFT reference value (178.0 GPa) is reported.


Elastic constants
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

3. :math:`C_{11}` error (%)

The elastic constant :math:`C_{11}` is computed using a stress-strain approach
on a 4x4x4 BCC supercell. Small positive and negative strains
(:math:`\pm 10^{-5}`) are applied along each Voigt direction, and the elastic
constants are extracted from the resulting stress differences. The percentage
error relative to the DFT reference value (296.7 GPa) is reported.

4. :math:`C_{12}` error (%)

Same as (3), for the elastic constant :math:`C_{12}`. Reference: 151.4 GPa.

5. :math:`C_{44}` error (%)

Same as (3), for the elastic constant :math:`C_{44}`. Reference: 104.7 GPa.


Vacancy formation energy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

6. :math:`E_{\mathrm{vac}}` error (%)

A single vacancy is created in a 4x4x4 BCC supercell by removing one atom.
Atomic positions are relaxed at fixed cell volume. The vacancy formation energy
is calculated as
:math:`E_{\mathrm{vac}} = E_{\mathrm{defect}} - E_{\mathrm{perfect}} + E_{\mathrm{coh}}`,
where :math:`E_{\mathrm{coh}}` is the cohesive energy per atom. The percentage
error relative to the DFT reference value (2.02 eV) is reported.


Bain path
^^^^^^^^^

7. BCC-FCC energy difference error (meV)

The Bain path maps the continuous tetragonal distortion from BCC
(:math:`c/a = 1`) to FCC (:math:`c/a = \sqrt{2}`). For each of 65 target
:math:`c/a` ratios between 0.72 and 2.0, a tetragonally distorted cell is
created and its volume is relaxed isotropically (uniform scaling preserving the
:math:`c/a` ratio). The absolute error in the BCC-FCC energy difference
relative to the DFT reference (83.5 meV/atom) is reported.


Surface energies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

8. Surface energy MAE (J/m²)

Surface energies are computed for the (100), (110), (111), and (112) cleavage
planes. For each surface, a slab is created with vacuum and the surface energy
is calculated as
:math:`\gamma = (E_{\mathrm{slab}} - E_{\mathrm{bulk}}) / 2A`.
Atomic positions are relaxed at fixed cell shape. The mean absolute error
across all four surfaces, relative to DFT reference values
(:math:`\gamma_{100}` = 2.41, :math:`\gamma_{110}` = 2.37,
:math:`\gamma_{111}` = 2.58, :math:`\gamma_{112}` = 2.48 J/m²), is reported.


Stacking fault energies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

9. Max SFE :math:`\{110\}\langle111\rangle` error (%)

The generalised stacking fault energy (GSFE) curve for the
:math:`\{110\}\langle111\rangle` slip system is computed by incrementally
displacing the upper half of a crystallographically oriented supercell along
the slip direction. The displacement covers one full Burgers vector
(:math:`b = a\sqrt{3}/2`) in 16 steps. Atoms are constrained to relax only
perpendicular to the fault plane. The percentage error in the maximum
(unstable) SFE relative to the DFT reference (0.75 J/m²) is reported.

10. Max SFE :math:`\{112\}\langle111\rangle` error (%)

Same as (9), for the :math:`\{112\}\langle111\rangle` slip system.
Reference: 1.12 J/m².


Traction-separation curves
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

11. Max traction (100) error (%)

A traction-separation curve is computed for the (100) cleavage plane by
incrementally separating crystal halves in 0.05 Å steps up to 5.0 Å, without
atomic relaxation, and measuring forces at each step. The traction (tensile
stress) is obtained from the sum of z-forces on the upper region divided by
the cross-sectional area. The percentage error in the maximum traction relative
to the DFT reference (35.0 GPa) is reported.

12. Max traction (110) error (%)

Same as (11), for the (110) cleavage plane. Reference: 30.0 GPa.

Phonons
=======

Summary
-------

Phonon dispersion and vibrational thermodynamics for 9958 bulk crystals from
the Alexandria phonon benchmark database (a PBE recomputation of the PBEsol
PhononDB/MDR phonon benchmark). The database provides PBE reference
structures, displacements, and force constants. For each MLIP, the structure
is relaxed using the FIRE optimiser with the ``FixSymmetry`` constraint
(fmax = 0.005 eV/Å, up to 1000 steps).
Forces for all displaced supercells are evaluated with the MLIP, and second-
order force constants are calculated and symmetrised on a 6x6x6 q-mesh. Band
structures are computed along the same high-symmetry path as the DFT reference
(101 q-points per segment). Thermal properties are computed on a 20x20x20
q-mesh.

Here, fixing symmetry is important: without it, a structure that
relaxes to a different crystal symmetry would have an incompatible Brillouin
zone path, making metrics such as Avg BZ MAE ill-defined. It also provides a
more stringent test of each MLIP's ability to match the DFT reference.


Metrics
-------

Frequencies are reported in Kelvin-equivalent units (THz x h/k\ :sub:`B`; 1 THz ≈ 48 K).
Thermal properties are evaluated at 300 K.

1. ω\ :sub:`max` MAE (K)

Mean absolute error of the MLIP and DFT maximum phonon frequency across all materials.

2. ω\ :sub:`avg` MAE (K)

Mean absolute error of the MLIP and DFT mean phonon frequency across all materials.

3. ω\ :sub:`min` MAE (K)

Mean absolute error of the MLIP and DFT minimum phonon frequency across all materials.
Because imaginary modes appear as negative values, this metric is sensitive to
whether a model incorrectly predicts dynamical instabilities.

4. S MAE (J/mol·K)

Mean absolute error of MLIP and DFT vibrational entropy at 300 K.

5. F MAE (kJ/mol)

Mean absolute error of the MLIP and DFT vibrational Helmholtz free energy at 300 K.

6. C\ :sub:`V` MAE (J/mol·K)

Mean absolute error of the MLIP and DFT constant-volume heat capacity at 300 K.

7. Avg BZ MAE (K)

Mean MAE of the phonon dispersion across the full Brillouin zone.
The MAE of each MLIP and DFT phonon dispersion branch is computed for a single
material and then the average error over all materials is computed.

8. Stability F1

F1 score for classifying dynamical stability. A material is classified as
stable when ω\ :sub:`min` > -2.4 K (-0.05 THz). Agreement with DFT is
classified as true positive, false positive, true negative, or false negative.


Computational cost
------------------

The DFT reference preprocessing (``test_phonons_ref``) runs once and takes
30 minutes to 1 hour on CPU or GPU, as it only processes pre-computed force
constants from the Alexandria database to generate band structures for later
comparison. This part of the test is marked ``slow``.

The MLIP evaluation (``test_phonons``) requires computing forces for all
displaced supercells of 9958 structures, taking 6-10 hours on GPU. Larger
models will be slower. This part of the test is marked ``very_slow``.

Elemental TM Vacancy Formation Energies
=======================================

Summary
-------

Performance in predicting vacancy formation energies for 42 fcc or hcp elemental transition metal structures.

Metrics
-------

1. MAE

Mean absolute error (MAE) between predicted and reference (PBE) vacancy formation energies values.

For each elemental transition metal structure, the vacancy formation enthalpy is determined by evaluating the total energy of the cell containing the monovacancy and evaluating the total energy of the undefected cell and comparing these. Note: the undefected cell energy is scaled by a fraction in order to conserve the appropriate number of atoms.

From the reference paper providing the structures, the elemental transition metals are a subset. Note:
    * For magnetic structures, the reference spin-polarized calculations only is used.
    * Unstable element-structure combinations are not included.

Computational cost
------------------

Low: tests are likely to take a couple of minutes to run on CPU.
