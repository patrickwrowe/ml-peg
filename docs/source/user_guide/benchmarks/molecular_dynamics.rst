Liquid densities
================

Summary
-------

Performance in predicting densities for 61 organic liquids, each system consisting of
about 1000 atoms. The dataset covers aliphatic, aromatic molecules, as well as different
functional groups and halogenated molecules.

Metrics
-------

1. Density error

For each system, the density is calculated by taking the average density of an NPT molecular
dynamics run. The initial part of the simulation, here 500 ps, is omitted from the density
calculation. This is compared to the reference density, obtained from experiment.

Computational cost
------------------

Very high: tests are likely to take several days to run on GPU.

Water ethanol density curves
============================

Summary
-------

Benchmark of the density of water-ethanol mixtures for different concentrations of ethanol, compare to experiment.
1 ns of NPT MD on about 120 water/ethanol molecules for 6 concentrations.


Metrics
-------

1. rms of the density difference.
2. rms of the excess volume difference.
3. Concentration of the minimal excess volume.


For each system, the density is calculated by taking the average density of an NPT molecular
dynamics run. The initial part of the simulation, here 500 ps, is omitted from the density
calculation. This is compared to the reference density, obtained from experiment.
The excess volume is computed as the difference between the actual molar volume of the mixture and the ideal molar volume obtained by linear combination of the pure-component molar volumes.
The concentration of the minimal excess volume is estimated by fitting a quadratic to the three grid points surrounding the minimum and taking the vertex of the parabola.

Computational cost
------------------

Very high: tests are likely to take several days to run on GPU.

Bond length distribution
========================

Summary
-------

Performance in maintaining physically reasonable covalent bond lengths during molecular
dynamics of small organic molecules. For each of a set of molecules covering the C-C, C=C,
C#C, C-N, C-O, C=O and C-F bond types, an NVT molecular dynamics simulation is run at 300 K
starting from a QM-optimised reference geometry, and the deviation of a tracked bond from
its reference length is measured along the trajectory.

Metrics
-------

1. Bond length deviation

The length of the tracked bond is measured at each frame of the trajectory, and its absolute
deviation from the reference bond length is averaged over the trajectory and across all
molecules. A well behaved potential keeps bonds close to their reference length, so a lower
deviation is better.

A histogram shows the distribution of the sampled bond length deviations for each model.

Computational cost
------------------

High: 8 molecules of 4-13 atoms, one MD simulation each, of 1,000,000 steps, i.e. 1 ns at a
1 fs timestep. The molecules are small, so the cost per step is dominated by per-call
overhead rather than by system size, and tests are likely to take a couple of hours per
model on GPU. Faster inference can be achieved using the jax-accelerated simulations in
MLIP Audit directly.

Data availability
-----------------

Input structures:

* MLIP Audit benchmark suite, InstaDeep. Reference geometries selected from the QM9 dataset
  (Ramakrishnan et al., Scientific Data 1, 140022, 2014).

Reference data:

* QM-optimised equilibrium bond lengths of the reference geometries.
