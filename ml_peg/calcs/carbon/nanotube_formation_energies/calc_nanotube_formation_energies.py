"""
Run calculations for carbon nanotube formation energies benchmark.

The 2021 ``nanotubes_formation_energy/test.py`` scores each tube against a
hardcoded isolated-atom reference (``single_atom_energy = 0.94664775`` eV, the
spin-unpolarised carbon atom) on the reference side, and the model's own
isolated-atom energy on the model side. That convention was self-consistent for
GAP-20, the model it was built around: the same offset appeared on both sides.
It does not generalise to an arbitrary model under test, whose own isolated-atom
energy carries whatever spin convention that model was trained on rather than
the reference's spin-unpolarised one. The published archive also no longer
ships an isolated atom to compute either side from.

This benchmark instead reports strain energy relative to graphene, with each
side using its own graphene energy (the model's graphene for the model series,
the DFT graphene for the reference series), exactly as ``defect_energies`` uses
each side's own pristine host:

``strain_energy_ev_per_atom = E_tube / n_tube - E_graphene / n_graphene``

The isolated-atom term cancels within each side and never appears. Graphene is
a fixed reference value, not a scored system, and no output structure is
written for it.

Every reference geometry is a single-point DFT calculation (``NSW = 1`` in all
20 shipped INCARs); the model is evaluated as a single point at each shipped
geometry, with no relaxation.
